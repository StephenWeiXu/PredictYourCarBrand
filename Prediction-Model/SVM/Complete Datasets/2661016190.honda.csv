every time king has my phone he never answer anyone's calls 😣
"that's good to hear, your the one that got hit or you crashed? thank godness he wasn't."
"omg what happen, are u ok?"
"hey i was starving , plus i'm eating for 2 people 😊"
ralph was surprised cus i ate that whole burrito by myself 😂

"on that note , ✌ time to get ready!"
we'll probably be out of here by 11 since none of us are ready.
i need to get the kids bag &amp; outfits ready since today they go to church 💒
"i honestly been wanting to get a perm though , just to see if my hair goes back to the way it used to be ."
"i asked king "" baby should i cut my hair &amp; he does no mommy "" with a mad face 😂"
as long as i have my plates paid &amp; insurance i'm good 👌
i thought i was gunna have a free check but with this whole car problem it doesn't look like i am 😩
your no better than me
you took the easy way out
"fuck i almost forgot i need to get my rent lowed down, before the first."
"i have to go pay the cable , and my light ."
"my days are never relaxing , i always have something to do!"
"its so hard not to think about it , but i gotta keep myself busy."
i wish king could just pass on some of his energy he has too much 😬
i hope it's the same way with jhené.
rt i wish a nigga that i messed w/ would try and talk shit
"with both kids i never had to work out to get back to my old body, it just did it on its own"
"i literally put everything on his hair to calm it down , and its calm for like 2 mins 😂"
"naz hair is uncontrollable, it's everywhere."

thank you love 💓
"aha yea that was a while back , when anthony was my baby😂 awe thank you!"
"&amp; then when he wakes up he goes "" goodmorning mommy"" 😍"
how is it that the kids feel it when your pregnant ? i don't understand
i love how he's so sweet with me💓
not one day does king not say i love you mommy before he goes to bed.
"where were u at before? and it has , i've been good you know working. trying to be super mommy 😊😄"
i really wanna throw king a party but then again i just wanna take him to a theme park i know he'll love that 👌
how are you doing by the way i haven't talked to you in the longest? 😊
but only few of them actually make it happen.
exactly that's what i'm trying to do cus here there's nothing everything is dead! i'm sure everyone would love to leave
right? and now that i have kids i don't want my kids in this shitty valley. they need more options plus i'd love to leave.
i just have to save because i honestly don't wanna go out there with nothing.
"but it's step by step , if anything by the end of this year i'll make it happen."
i know i'll have 100% support from my cousin and everyone of my fam out there.
&amp;honestly now that jhené is coming i really want a big change &amp; i think moving out of here will be the best thing to do for the kids &amp;myself
"i know if i wanted to i could move out there to where she lives , it's just a matter of me making it happen ."
"seeing my cousins life change completely since she moved out the valley, makes me really wanna get out of here."
now i wanna go to bed but for some reason jhené wants to be up all hyper 😍
both kiddos are ko'd 👏
sometimes i wonder what if?
i was already the edge why couldn't you just leave me there?
rt i'm sorry for being a bitch
there's a lot of things i shouldn't be doing work like mopping and swiping but i still do it cus then my day goes by so if i don't .
"i'm so mad because he lost venum , and he had barley got it . but i'm sure someone fucken stole it !"
i have a habit of buying king toys that he doesn't even need .
can't wait for payday so i can buy the kids all the sport balls &amp; and basketball net 🏀
that's gunna be our everyday thing now .
and then off i go to pick up my babies and go to the park 😊
30 more mins and i'm off 🙌
after work ima take my babies to the park to burn off some energy
"i hate that his friends always call my phone , but i never answer and text them call his babymomma he's there 😂"
best believe pay back is a bitch!
i totally forgot to call to make my ultrasound appointment.
3 more hours and i'm off 🙌
my internet is acting up big time 😡
some hot cheetos with cheese 😋
it's so hard to explain theses things to him but like the lady said we have to tell him the truth 😔
"he asked me , mom why daddy not live with me? 😔 shit crushed my heart into pieces 💔"
it's crazy because now king ask about everything?
"one thing is to give me hopes , but to give my son hopes and not follow through now that's the fucked up part 👊"
"like they say actions speak louder than words , and my actions will show👌"
i'm so over this

"today's class we learned how to make playdoe , it's so much fun 😊"
"king randomly says "" i wanna go with mikey"" i was like tf who's mikey?"
and then he decided to wet all my white shirt just so he can see my boobs perv 😄
"and his dumbass did , so i did it back 😂👏"

"my cousin is so lucky she's in hawaii , i'm so jealous 😏"
rt it's not about who did it first.. it's about who did it right
