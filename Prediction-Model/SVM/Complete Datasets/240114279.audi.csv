really don't care for sympathy so maybe that's why i chose the crack of dawn to release my thoughts
"dr said if i waited 1 more day i would've died. them words didn't ring until day 5 still there. my system had shut down, bowels and all."
"woke up midnight cramping &amp; couldn't stand up straight. threw up once, got to the er, an hr passed &amp; they were rushing me to surgery."
my appendix ruptured 3days prior to vday &amp; i had no clue. said to bring a grown man to his knees so i guess i have a high tolerance for pain
"had emergency surgery and the next thing i know, i'm getting enemas every 2 hours, 8pills and 2 suppositories twice a day 😤 they had no clue"
"i spent 11 days in the ""best"" hospital in this city, ku med and they didn't have a clue on how to get me better"
i swear i take everybody with a grain of salt. sucks to live looking at ppl like 😒 but this world don't know how to be pure
"so yea whether i'm with someone or not, that day will never mean anything to me."
"i take that back, i had an admirer before, and a guy that i liked but he bought me &amp; one other girl a rose. ."
i've only had one valentine. and he gave me a teddy bear that sung and i could tell it wasn't new. .
"coming up on the day i almost died. valentine's day don't mean nothing to me, that day last year, all i could think about was living"
i'm passed determined. don't wanna settle. i see more for me. just gotta be stingy
"ready for these quick trips to different cities, getting my brand to the level i see it at #focused #fashiondesigner"
"god's will, i'll be too busy for everybody once i get things up and running. #focused #fashiondesigner"
up exhausted . 😓
