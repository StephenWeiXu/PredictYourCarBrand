shattered 😴
cannot wait to see sehra
😁
good morning you pretty young thing! hope you're feeling better today!
"late night showrooms don't even open at the right 'late night' times, my flight leaves in 7 hours 😒"
flew all the way out to germany to test drive my a5 before i get some details changed and the audi showroom isn't even open yet
it saddens me that some of the worst things happen to the greatest people. nobody should have to suffer so much at such a young age.
my little brother is growing up too quickly man
"i know i don't get to see her a lot but, i am too lucky!!"
"my girl is so beautiful, man!"
saw my bestfriend in treatment for the first time today and she couldnt talk properly or walk i could actually see how much pain she was is😞
people give up on their relationships so easily these days
the case a fought this morning made me realize a lot of things!
the justice system is so messed up
upsetting realizing that sehra' leaving for toronto tomorrow
rt this is why i've always believed good men are for good women. and good women for good men🙌
rt legend
"for once in my life, i actually feel exhausted"
sometimes terrible things happen to amazing people.
i can't wait to see you and hold you!
"you're doing great you know, keep fighting champ 😃"
"but truth be told i wouldn't want my girl to change, i love her crazy ass"
&amp; also put up with our girl when she starts speaking to you in a different language 😩 foreign girls aren't easy brother 😭
"us men that have a girlfriend who is from a different ethic background have to deal with some crazy attitude, random moods"
don't think i've ever seen someone close to in such a crazy amount of pain then i did today 😞
turn ur whatsapp notifications on!! if the pain doesn't go down or if the bleeding doesn't stop just give one of us a message
what a day.
the only good thing about going back is that i get to see my new slk
not looking forward to going back to england
"be honest tell me what doc said, because you're acting like everything's things ok, i know you're hiding something"
"6 figure salary, everyday."
"my girl is going to give me the most amazing, precious gift in the whole world soon."
"it's embarrassing af if you're loyal to someone, showing them off and shit and they're flirting with other people lowkey smh"
wether is so shit here today
"everyone knew he was like that anyway, hope she's alright though"
it's absolutely embarrassing
"nah this can't be right, how can you fuck up like that 😳"
"hope you've been ok today, chin up sum! x"
this is everything. she looks so unreal in her celine dress tonight. 😍
finally touched down in milan with my girl!
flights been delayed😠
rt as you get older you start to see who was raised properly. so many people lack basic respect and manners.
rt “the best super bowl commercial ever 😂😭
finally seeing my girl after 3 weeks 😍
"my best friend is fighting to live a longer life everyday. i beg some of you stupid people, don't make her life harder than it already is."
my last rt 😂 nahh
rt when someone using your weights in the gym
rt when your barber is a versace ambassador.
"back in england, this weather is so miserable 😣"
did you see andre the other day?
good luck for later champ 😊
rt my girlfriend isn't afraid of anyone. that's one of the things i love about her.
"no not yet i heard he's done some insane stuff to it, why have you?"
my girl is literally a blessing
rt when some dudes talking to your girl and you trying to figure out who to slap first
rt how white people run out of a house fire vs. black people
"hope you're good sum, things will start looking up soon! speak to you soon x"
"eric's been trying to get in touch with you, i'll drop his number in a dm"
rt sorry i forgot to ask you: anybody want to be a monkey like me??
so glad that meetings over
rt arabian girls always stay winning in my eyes
quick catch up with mario in down housten and then off to my 2nd meeting today
fuck sake 😂
leaving england for a week ✈️✈️✈️
hey have you two eaten? if you guys need anything just let me or sehra know x
rt would anyone at the care to explain why she is a 'religion fanatic' and not an extremist?
"after a week of hard work, our home cinema is finally finished 🎥"
"rt if you don't start appreciating what's right in front of you, you might lose it."
"minus all of that, today was a good day!"
but you can't because you're tryna show your girl that you're becoming a better person and don't let fuckboys get to you anymore 😒
when you &amp; your girl walk past a group of fuckboys and you clocked they whistled at her and all you wanna do is upper cut each one them 😩
did you watch those vids from last night?? and did you get that picture? 😩
"you had no chill last night, seriously had everyone laughing 😩"
morning
😂
"nah this you, foreal 😂"
case went so well today
"rt if you got a girl that's holding you down and you out here fuckin' her over, you stupid. ain't nothing out here."
yess sum 😁
glad sehra loved her ring 😬
rt idk how people use being drunk as an excuse for cheating like i've gotten pretty fucked up but i'm still aware of wtf…
"rt why are you a lord?""......why are you a dick head ?"
christmas has been goodddd

such a busy day today
rt basically
times like this makes me feel so helpless
i promise to be a better person if the saints make the playoffs.

ay but that's non of my business
too many guys out here afraid to give their girl a little attention. instead they giving other girls that attention she needs.
"i got a phone call 10 minutes ago, sum isn't well at all! won't be able to make it sorry man"
"oh my days sehra bit on my arm so hard. i think if i didn't tell to stop, she would've taken a chunk out of my arm! 😩"
