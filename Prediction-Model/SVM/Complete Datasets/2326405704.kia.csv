once more into the fray. into the last good fight i will ever know... live and die on this day. live and die on this day.
"gotta admit, big fan of the chicago vibe."
what parameters are we basing this on?
"thanks for the hookup, treated us like henry hill in goodfellas."
the fact that i have to drive around chicago in a kia soul on st. patrick's day weekend is the most demeaning time of my life
is that a good or bad thing
the tests have never come back conclusive.
"check your messages, have an off public question"
"thanks man, good looking out. only brought one pair of pants."
however is that doesn't work out whats another good one.
i am downtown right now but if i get a pair of slacks and a button up is the steak worth it?
we would be looking to go in around lunch. do they loosen up the dress code during the day? i can get slacks
i don't think i have the proper dress attire or for the restaurant i only have cargo pants and button ups with sneakers
does this count as dressing like a bum
"could be a good video, i am shaped like danny devito"
"can we do a ""franco makeover to get into chicago cuta"
"ok, given me the minimal i have to wear."
"in chicago w/2 colleagues, super laid back people. looking for steakhouse. not sure if you have a connects."
talked to bill nye at lunch today. not a bad day.
pretty excited to hear neil shubin talk transitional fossils.
"or if you want a good intro with a philly artist, resurrect some old will smith"
pretty sure i found the perfect intro song for the podcast. really captures our essence.
what about urban saloon?
the explanation as to why the philly podcast is not on itunes is at the 47:35 mark here. i blame
"chicagoans, is it worth eating at ditka's steak house? or is just a tourist thing. need a good steak house recommendation in the city."
good morning chicago.
that was one one of many servings.
made friends w/ the flight attendant who was a patriots fan. kept feeding me free drinks. 5 deep on the 2 hour flight. slight buzz
aaannnnddddd i accidentally brought a knife through tsa.
however cassowary babies might be the cutest animal on earth.
"if you are looking for the last real dinosaurs, it is the cassowary. eviscerate the shit out of you."
moose will wreck you. had a run in with one in alaska. trick is to run in a zig zag pattern into dense trees.
"then i say we go 100%, patio furniture with a table and an umbrella. no sense in half-assing it."
right now soundcloud is the best option. we are dealing with a clusterfuck to get it on itunes
new podcast gear is awesome. now just need more comfortable chairs.
i was in a pretty serious meeting and was trying to follow all this #eagles shit. i am so damn confused about meeting content and eagles.
no one of going to be more excited about the knockout video than i finally finish it.
"i don't consider myself white, i am more of an olive color due to my middle eastern heritage."
"alright, bulliet rye it is my good man. good ol' american."
i will have time. i finish work at 3:30pm today. no meetings. any preference?
i have a feeling recording tonight's podcast with and is going to be hilarious? should i get more whiskey?
"wait, are the eagles a racist team? should i ignore this or be mad at them? ?"
"the most exciting part of going to a conference is the king size bed where i can sit shirtless, watch tv, and eat without anyone judging me."
"much like jeter, he left his overnight guests with a souvenir?"
do you like fish sticks?
best pizza in la is legit east coast pizza. my go to spot.
did barstool change the webpage layout?
"oh fuck, just realized i will be in chicago from wednesday - sunday this week. definitely not eating shitty deep dish pizza."
"dont get me wrong, i love shitting in my historical greek marble bathroom at work, but the wifi in here sucks. too many marble walls."
"dammit, and here i am sitting with a bunch of stock bagel bites with zero aftermarket modifications."
slummin' it with bagel bites this morning.
i am done with work in about 30 minutes but feel the grumblings of a twosie. debating on doing it now or waiting for the comfort of home.
rt motorcade escort for fallen officer robert wilson #finest #lodd
rt p/o robert wilson iii thank you 4 your service &amp; sacrifice. you will never be forgotten young brother. …
i just got high-fived by a very fat 13 year old because i said the word bacon. it is all downhill from here.
"don't sweat it, buffalo is in the rust belt. been through it, and quickly at that."
coming down from that rock/paper/scissors victory?
its like you haven't read my twitter profile.
rt guy's got a lot of protection for hibernation.
rt just saw get knocked out after sixers game is a lot fatter than i imagined
"i am awkward on land, but like my brethren the mighty leopard seal i am dangerous in water."
the t-shirt gatling gun is the pinnacle of human ingenuity #sixerslive #sixers
so you were mentally raped?
rt psh. i could have done that shit if they gave me another chance and body. #flightsquadsmitty
"lets go easy on him, its bad enough he had to ride in my patriots emblazoned car to the sixers game."
air mo.
rt still haven't forgiven betsy ross for breathing down my neck.
i am just here to watch play knockout. lets us not forget and his epic air ball last year.
"just says ""2020, after the virus"". nothing really mentioned. just watched first episode."
"watching ""last man on earth"" and it is pretty funny."
"anyone on here watch ""behind the mask""?"
like you could have made your way into be a director on set.
i am more curious how far down the rabbit hole you would have gotten before getting fired.
"it is called ""rectilinear motion"" if you are interested in googling it. pretty fascinating muscle system in place"
then undulate their muscle (like when a belly dancer makes her stomach look like a wave).
"their are 4 methods, but the one you are probably referring to is how they slowly creep forward."
what building do you live in? damn. i go visit friends in the gehry building all the time and don't expect that kind of service.
"i know, why would he release teal shoes?"
"i would wager if you look at the photo into a very very dark room, like almost zero light you will see black/blue."
"maybe, but you can train your eyes/brain to shift back and forth between the colors on one image."
i will almost guarantee that dress photo has too much light and some brains correct and see black/blue while others don't and see white/gold
"in essence, your brain is trying to correct the colors depending on if you think the photo is over or under exposed."
light is pretty cool. if you were in a room w/ only a red light and had a red object it would appear white to you.
basically the colors surrounding the other colors influence how we perceive them because of our limited color sensing ability.
well a common illusion because we only have two photoreceptors. we can't pick up subtle differences. each person varies in ability.
this is a perfect example...
"not just light, it is a common illusion, for instance i can now shift between seeing the two different dresses."
"for instance, we only have two types of photoreceptors in our eyes. a mantis shrimp has 12. imagine the color differentiation they have."
last tweet extremely oversimplified but only had140 characters to explain. varying people can see different wavelengths of light.
the color of the dress depends on how much light your eye is letting in. if you see white and gold you can squint and make it black &amp; blue.
the worst part of this situation is my colleagues laughing hysterically outside the bathroom door. mostly because this has happened before.
"oh god, the microbes in that fish tank water i accidentally drank yesterday have decided my intestines are not a place they like."
just noticed i tweeted at 4am. thought i had dreamed that. insomnia is a mother fucker. may need to remove myself from active duties today.
i haven't had a full night's sleep in months? years? i don't know. telling time when you feel permanently jet lagged becomes impossible.
"""when you have insomnia you're never really asleep and you're never really awake"". truest words ever spoken."
"yeah, not my favorite, but had a few in the back of the fridge."
"eugenie clark died today, the famous shark lady. lucky enough to learn from her. to you genie..."
i did tell her it was the greatest biscuit i have ever eaten. also didn't help her daughter was asleep naked upstairs.
"as you have seen, i do not show the smartest behaviors with significant others. especially for a guy in my station of life."
exactly. wouldn't have been as bad if the mother didn't walk in as i was taking the last bite. i was alone and hungry.
"well, i did dig through their freezer chest and found it in a plastic bag. in my defense, there was no special label."
i guess when he visited that was their thing. he would make his famous biscuits. even defrosted it was fucking delicious.
however in my defense i was not aware of the sentimental value of said biscuit.
"i once accidentally ate the last biscuit my ex-girlfriend's grandfather ever baked before dying. it was in the freezer, defrosted it, ate it"
first rumblings from the aquarium water incident are being felt. 100% chance the video we release tomorrow was edited on my toilet.
"laziness. when i post something and a person asks me who or what it is i reply ""tgif"" try google its free."
"the best part was someone put down three while others missed out. the email chain that resulted was hilarious, especially out of context."
"one of my colleagues does ""hump day hotdogs"" where he cooks hotdogs in a crockpot for everyone. scientifically perfected water temp/time."
debating on starting an antibiotic regimen or just letting these microbes run their course. over the next 24-48 hours.
i knew there was a 50/50 chance i would swallow some water. took a calculated risk.
"yeah, i have a 12-24 hour window before my intestines respond. sadly this is not the first time i have done this."
rt . you are low-key the craziest motherfucker/biggest wild card at barstool
so i accidentally drank some water out of one of our fish tanks. this is going to be an interesting afternoon.
"forgot travel coffee mug, made use of what i had around me. drank 200ml so far."
you haven't lived until you have had a oceanic white tip shark give you a bump and a look over.
you son of a bitch. i am at work for a couple more hours. then it is straight to the taco truck. diarrhea be damned.
rt side note: kitty litter does the same!
i am going to make up for it by eating a shitload of taco's tonight.
tip for those parallel parking on streets w/ snow and ice. keep road salt in car. shake it around tires when you park. won't get stuck.
"damn i am jealous. i brought a lettuce, tomato, and avocado sandwich on multigrain bread to work. i deserve a dick punch."
"taco cat is a palindrome. let that sink in. speaking of, i would kill for some tacos."
"went with a ""pop art"" theme for my cat elroy's portrait."
if anyone wants these 12x12 (yoda on wood). i am selling them for $60 or $100 for both. no room for them.
took apart the old hornets nest and made some art.
goes without saying my crown design won the night.
didn't join my sister and brother in law tonight and she sends me this.
wore a barstool t-shrt to an event with some high end fashion moguls. you're welcome.
no context needed for this photo.
"not mine, it's my brother-in-law's skateboard company. krooked skateboards."
way ahead of you.
scrawled on toilet paper in the hotel. it's cryptic but i think i can crack it.
rt how is franco not a thing yet? guy is beautiful

i used to play bass in an all girl band. kind of miss it. pic was taken when we opened for polyphoni spree at the tla
"i am staying near mccormick place. not sure what my time will be like, but evenings are usually free."
"no promises because of the conference, may be able to get a st. paddy's video in for barstool."
going to be staying in downtown chicago for a conference march 11-15th.
just found out i will be in chicago for a conference during st. patricks day.
conference in chicago in march. looking forward to a hotel room by myself.
both darwin and lincoln were born today in 1809.
"my dr. actually wrote ""has the chemical tolerance of a bull. double the normal dose on medications."""
"it didn't say anything about snakes or tortoises. i can bring a leash for my tortoise, he is quick, but not that quick."
let's say i want to take 20 snakes in my carry on. all secured in bags. it's cool w/ the tsa? airline is who i ask?
so i am allowed to go through tsa security with live animals on domestic flights?
"she can go through the x-ray machine, it would actually be a big help. i think she has eggs, would love to confirm."
"right, but my concern is when i go through tsa they will confiscate it."
am i allowed to bring my therapy tortoise on a flight? he fits in overhead compartment or under the seat if it's a full flight.
am i allowed to bring my therapy tortoise on a flight? he fits in an overhead compartment or under the seat if it's a full flight.
there is a black hole joke here but i am too tired to come up with it in 95 characters.
"damn, i have run into that before. i get it. regardless killer job on the video. you are have a great camera presence."
"killed it in ""uptown funk"". you guys need to put that on youtube so it can be shared more easily."
"there are a few of us here who watch the league. so we use the code word ""yobagoya"" for a signal. no one has caught on yet."
"just emailed a female colleague ""yobogoya"" which she knew meant ""cover my station i need to run to the toilet."" love my colleagues."
by buddy sent me a blowdart gun in the mail. it is like he wanted me to get divorced/arrested.
"that tweet satiated the hunger for your take. throwing are ""ye's"" and ""yeezi"" is exactly what i needed."
"come on now. i know her favorite flowers, getting those. also, can i pay you a $1 retainer so she can't use you?"
really could use a blog from you about the whole kanye/beck situation.
i forgot about that. too many balls in the air. can't juggle them forever. i will order flowers.
still not sure if my wife is mad after listening to us record that. at this point i am in my own head. psywarops.
lactose tolerant people are the mutation. lactose intolerant was the original standard (saving breast milk).
if you graduated in the mid to late 2000's with under 20k you are doing well.
rt beck's 'sea change' is the greatest break-up album ever recorded.
basically why beck is a much better artist than beyonce.
"recording a podcast about valentines day, and past girlfriends while your wife is in the room might be the bravest/dumbest thing i have done"
"just recorded this weeks podcast w/ a batchelor, a guy w/ a girlfirned, and a married man discuss valentines day."
"a museum dedicated to the history of physiology, highlighted with anatomical abnormalities? must see."
then don't every come to philly because i will take you to the mütter museum.
"nsfw for that? weak. i was eating a blt while looking at that and was like ""eh""."
did you try turning it off and back on again?
jokes on him. i have been pissing all over philadelphia for the last decade.
got any gum? throw half a bag of big league chew on there and go to town on it.
i was just saying i don't have experience with this when diving. always made sure i was equalized before surfacing.
"i was always able to equalize when scuba diving. because he wasn't in the water, this sounds like trapped air."
"seriously, if this isn't gone in 24 hours go to er. if you don't release the pressure it can rupture an eardrum."
i have been there. it is fucking hell. try moving jaw side to side. need to manipulate sinuses to move liquid.
or keep chewing and moving your jaw. if it doesn't work try an antihistamine (flu medicine). after 24 hours er.
have you tried holding your nose and mouth shut and blowing out as hard as you can? forces air into nasals.
then you should follow this simple plan....
i will never judge a human on what brings them joy. i respect the fact you know what yours is.
all i want to do is sit on the couch eating pizza and watching netlfix. it's all i ever wanted.
i have learned money doesn't make me happy. i have plenty to survive.
kanye makes oedipus rex look humble.
after last night i am making it priority 1. ranks above my marriage and my job now.
"rt if i win the powerball, i'll spend probably a good 30% finding ways to troll kanye."
in fairness i am much older (and fatter) than you. i have had many more bagel experiences.
i heard international phone cards are the next hot thing.
1000% chance they develop a pyramid scheme and think it's innovative.
everything hands down.cinnamon raisin is a borderline pastry.
sees the world like malkovitch when he goes through the portal of his own head.
"not going to lie, this is my favorite song."
kanye was good. however i have an issue with him saying beck isn't a real artist.
rt before last night i had no idea who beck was
jesus that is sad. guy is an incredible artist. saw him live this summer. from 1994
