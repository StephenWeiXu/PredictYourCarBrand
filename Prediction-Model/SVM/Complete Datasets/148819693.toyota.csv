silva out jumps john terry to score from a corner. i guess he wanted it more. #lionheart
does it count if it's part of a double?
ex-players are even celebrating the goal on twitter
rt luuuiiizzzz!!!
now that is a celebration against a former team.
my thoughts exactly.
"rt john terry was so eager to whinge to the referee, he stood on oscar's head. dick."
if i didn't know better i'd think that the referee was unduly influenced by the intimidation by chelsea players.
just spotted your bet but was too late to get on it. if fabregas scores i think i'll throw up!
"have we had a better one since?maybe vick, but i think mcnabb was more solid.i'm sure terrell owens would agree he's overrated!"
"also, is it weird that i have a bit of a thing for yer one on channel 4 with the big hat who interviews the jockeys? #poshtotty"

who are you getting 6/1 with mate?
"not at all miguel, as long as you keep the banter level at 'harmless'."
"his blog is almost too partridge-esque, it's one of the most magnificent things on the internet."
"on more than 1 occasion, he's tried to defend himself by saying it 'was not his phrase'."
"he holds jamie responsible for the phrase 'smash it', despite the fact it was he who said it on camera."
analysis is so fucked up on the telly these days that it could easily have been the other way around.
