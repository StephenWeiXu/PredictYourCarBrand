"i'm not saying people that do drink or whatever don't bust their ass, i'm wondering why they're not being responsible"
there'sa reason why getting high and drinking under 21 is illegal. why should they get praised if they're doing illegal activity
still get the exact same privellages.
yeah and i understand. i just think its dumb when people obey the law and bust their ass when kids do nothing but party and
or get high.. problem solved i guess? haha you would think people are smart enough.. but they aren't
for some it ruins their career they're going into college for. your coach finds out you're kicked off&amp;who's going to want you?
kids my age are idiots
okay hahaha
