"currently booking appointments,promoting,and watching my children play outside...😊"
i have grown to love her in 45 minutes she is really and clearly a sweet little baby and she's so pretty she will bounce back lol
she's human and the only difference is she's dating a celebrity and every other woman is not but going through the same things or worse!
honestly made me love the girl....😍😫
just watched the karuchee interview with ...tears fell a few times
rt people i pray for - myself - family - people i know - people i don't know - people that don't like me - people i don't…
"don't judge the way i have changed,worry about why you're still the same...."
it takes entirely too much energy to spend mad...especially when i have no reason to be 😏
"i am free!...im done with the hardened heart!..i've hurt ppl,ppl have hurt me!...im over anger and animosity!"
rt i wannna go back to sleep so bad
rt black is such a beautiful color
someone switched their broken ass charger with mine and i'm angry about it!..and i have mica any other charger so im pretty much fucked 😒
do what you have to do to get what you have to get done...

don't doubt me....believe in me...i would say as much as i believe in myself but idk if you can handle that much 😊😉
"sangria,baby,and 50 shades of gray 😍"
the money is already in motion.....
"my friends stimulate my mind,our conversations be super deep and educational lol we just want happiness and success...all of it!..🙌"
i asked my baby what she wants to be when she gets older bad she said kadynce 😍 lol at least she knows who she is already lol
i just want to be nothing but happy and positive!.i don't want any negative thinking or energy around or inside of me!..none!..

i've missed these gals ☺️ ....diamond being a baby stealer lol

some things you can't control....control the things you can.....
"be happy,be genuine,be loving...be the change you wish to see...."
i sometimes can't control my anger....but the older i get the more important i realize being conscious of my anger and the way i show it is
"once you learn how to control the way you think,you'll be perfectly fine with the results in your life....you attract what you focus on...."
change your mind change your life...i thought negatively about three times this morning&amp;corrected myself each time w/ positive affirmations🙌
you can't control how ppl feel about you but you can also realize that's none of your business....if it isnt positive it doesn't matter
"ppl who have hurt me,i forgive them...my kindness will make more of a difference than my noticed anger and unapproachable stance...."
i'm choosing happiness....the craziness has brought nothing but anger and lingering animosity to be truly free you must let some things go!.
"ppl will ultimately do to you what they want to do and what they feel is right,your job is to choose what you do or how you react..."
"im over the animosity,anger &amp;the negative feelings concerning issues and ppl in my past...im done allowing it to control my mind negatively"
i decided to get better not bitter....
