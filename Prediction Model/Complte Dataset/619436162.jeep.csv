"i'm not that female that's only going to stay at home and ""take care of your house"" i'm going to have a career"
"you are perfectly capable of doing things on your own, you don't need me here to do everything for you."
do you only feel like a man when you have someone to assert your dominance over?
i feel like tomorrow is the day
just waiting on some good news to finally hit

rt i was always taught to think highly of yourself. being regular is not acceptable
they're eventually just gonna start throwing certifications at people because the hard workers can't afford it
how do you expect to be able to help someone that's struggling if you can't even get to where they are?
"success is based off of who you know now, not what you know. reason as to why many incompetent people have high positions"
expect the unexpected.
"i cared too much before, got my feelings hurt frfr but that really taught me the concept of life."
but when it comes to band i've had more downs than ups. more stress than i should have.
